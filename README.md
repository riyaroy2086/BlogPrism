###### I have built the BlogPrism in order to learn State Management in React, Tailwind CSS and the properties of GraphQL . With GraphQL , it's easier to fetch data and use it accordingly . The GraphCMS allows a very beginner-friendly process to consider different variables (schemas, models and fields) in any website . I have used moment library for data type and sass for styling purpose. 
###### Deployed using vercel :-
